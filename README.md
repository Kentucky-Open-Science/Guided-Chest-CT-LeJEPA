# DALE-CT: Depth-Aware 2D Slice Encoders Learn an Anatomical World Model of Chest CT

Training code and model release for **DALE-CT** (Depth-Aware Latent-Euclidean
Computed Tomography) — a family of 2D slice-based Vision Transformers trained
entirely from scratch on chest CT with the heuristics-free
[LeJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08544) objective and **depth-aware slab
sampling**: self-supervised views are drawn from across a physical $z$-axis
slab rather than a single slice, so the frozen representations form an
**anatomical world model** — they linearly decode volumetric slice position
($R^2 \approx 0.97$), recover slice ordering without labels, and localize
organs and findings, despite no 3D or positional supervision.

**Paper:** [DALE-CT: Depth-Aware 2D Slice Encoders Learn an Anatomical World Model of Chest CT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.07775)
· **Benchmark:** [chest-ct-foundation-model-benchmark](https://github.com/Kentucky-Open-Science/chest-ct-foundation-model-benchmark) —
the single-protocol evaluation harness, patient-disjoint splits, and full
result tables for every model in the paper

## Released models

All weights are on the Hugging Face Hub (CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0); the DALE-CT
variants load in one line via `timm` (Finetuned DINOv2 is a `transformers`
model — see its card):

```python
import timm
model = timm.create_model("hf-hub:Kentucky-Open-Science/DALE-CT-0-L", pretrained=True)
```

| Model | CT-RATE Macro AUROC | RAD-ChestCT AUROC (frozen / retrained probe) | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| [DALE-CT-0-L](https://huggingface.co/Kentucky-Open-Science/DALE-CT-0-L) ⭐ | 0.8156 | 0.6281 / **0.7572** | **Recommended general-purpose backbone** — best 2D external-transfer point estimates; supervision-free at ~287k-scan scale |
| [DALE-CT-2S](https://huggingface.co/Kentucky-Open-Science/DALE-CT-2S) | **0.8247** | 0.6252 / 0.7389 | Best in-domain (CT-RATE) |
| [DALE-CT-1S-v2](https://huggingface.co/Kentucky-Open-Science/DALE-CT-1S-v2) | 0.8098 | 0.6284 / 0.7334 | Anatomical (TotalSegmentator) dense supervision only |
| [DALE-CT-0](https://huggingface.co/Kentucky-Open-Science/DALE-CT-0) | 0.8057 | 0.5946 / 0.7477 | Pure self-supervised, CT-RATE |
| [Finetuned DINOv2](https://huggingface.co/Kentucky-Open-Science/Finetuned-DINOv2-Chest-CT) | 0.7953 | 0.6252 / 0.7550 | Continual-pretraining baseline |

The earlier [DALE-CT-1S](https://huggingface.co/Kentucky-Open-Science/DALE-CT-1S)
release (patch-14, `[CLS]`-only anatomical supervision) remains available as
the backbone used by [Ker-VLJEPA-3B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.23308);
DALE-CT-1S-v2 is the configuration benchmarked in the paper.

All numbers are our own head-to-head measurements: every model in the paper
(including public 3D baselines COLIPRI-CRM, Merlin, CT-FM, CT-CLIP) is probed
under one linear-probing MIL protocol on shared splits with bootstrap
confidence intervals. The protocol, splits, and result tables are maintained
in the [chest-ct-foundation-model-benchmark](https://github.com/Kentucky-Open-Science/chest-ct-foundation-model-benchmark)
repository. Each model card documents the exact Hounsfield-Unit
preprocessing its backbone expects — **DALE-CT-0-L uses different
normalization statistics than the CT-RATE-trained variants.**

The evaluation harness above is kept as released with the paper; the
maintained, self-contained version — including the protocol documentation —
is the [chest-ct-foundation-model-benchmark](https://github.com/Kentucky-Open-Science/chest-ct-foundation-model-benchmark)
repository.

Dataset preparation (CT-RATE → WebDataset shards, TotalSegmentator masks)
lives in a separate preprocessing pipeline that is not yet public.

Paths in configs refer to our cluster layout; point them at your own data
roots. Raw datasets and checkpoints are never stored in this repository.
